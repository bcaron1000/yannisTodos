Project description:
I implemented the Add page and Edit page. On the add page, I made it so the start date would update once being added to the list along with the start time. On my edit page, I put my values in a DDL, allowing the user to update the status of the isCompleted. Also, considering the value of the start date is already created, I found it did not make sense for them to edit the todo and make a new start time. I used font awesome icons for building the UI, and I feel like the input values on the add, and edit pages give it more of an interactive user-friendly look.
