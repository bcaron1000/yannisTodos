Project description:
I implemented the Add page and Edit page. On the add page, I followed your design class. On my edit page, I put my values in a DDL, allowing the user to update the status of the isCompleted. I used font awesome icons for building the UI, and I feel like the input values on the add, and edit pages give it more of an interactive user-friendly look.
